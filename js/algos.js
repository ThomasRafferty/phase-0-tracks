// I got so into studying for ruby I put JS off and completely do not get it, yet have also not put in the time.  Will spend this week hard at work figuring out where I'm at, sorry for this poor attempt at an assignment.

//Loop through strings in the array finding the longest string, possible update as we go through
function return_longest(input_array);
  for (var i = 0, i < array.length, i++){
    if input_array[i].length > input_array[i+1].length
    longest_string = input_array[i]
    p longest_string
