// In JavaScript I am going to write a function that will reverse strings using the example hello.  First we will declare a variable set to a sting which we can input into the function I am building.  In the function we will need three statements.  First, we will initialize the counter.  Next we will set a condition that will determine the length of the of the loop (Is this needed on a string, like it was on an integer?).
var str = "Reverse me"


// I am just not getting this write now, not sure how the i work in the loop in order to work backwards.
for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
  console.log(str[i])
}
