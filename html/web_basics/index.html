  <h1>An Eternal Friendship </h1>
  <p> Humanity first began its historic co-evolution with dogs 15,000 years ago before the Agricultural Revolution.  This eternal friendship has lasted to the presesnt day and is <strong> long before cats entered the picture</strong> and started compeating for attention.  Even though dogs are the superior pet to many, <em> both cats and dogs are wonderful companions.</em> If one has the means, then I highly suggest a pet. </p>
