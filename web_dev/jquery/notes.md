Plan to take jQuery.
1. Google definition of jQuery to get a better understanding of its function within JavaScript, try to get a broad understanding and possible resources. (approx. 15 min)
2. Look to see if there is a short video <15 min on YouTube introducing jQuery and its capabilities similar to what is pursued in (1.)
3. Find or write some code to play around with in terms of jQuery. (10-15 min)
4. Take a 10 min break
5. Complete step 3 if not done so already (do not let this step become mission creep - approx 10 if needed)
6. Play around with jQuery for 20 min, try to get things to run.
7. Take 5 min break
8. Now that you have probably hit some stumbling blocks go back and do some more research, try to figure out what was holding you back (15 min).
9. Play around with your new skills with jQuery for 15 more min, see what you can create.
10. Save and turn in.
