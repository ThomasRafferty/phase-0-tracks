Plan to take jQuery.
1. Google definition of jQuery to get a better understanding of its function within JavaScript, try to get a broad understanding and possible resources. (approx. 15 min)
2. Look to see if there is a short video <15 min on YouTube introducing jQuery and its capabilities similar to what is pursued in (1.)
3. Find or write some code to play around with in terms of jQuery.  See if there are online resources to play jQuery in JSFiddle or something like it (10-15 min)
4. Take a 10 min break
5. Complete step 3 if not done so already (do not let this step become mission creep - approx 10 if needed)
6. Play around with jQuery for 20 min, try to get things to run.
7. Take 5 min break
8. Now that you have probably hit some stumbling blocks go back and do some more research, try to figure out what was holding you back (15 min).
9. Play around with it some more, try to figure out what you dont know to possibly look into later.
10. Save and turn in.



I did not follow the plan of attack described above.  I found first researching the history and basic idea of jQuery to be helpful, giving what I was working on some context.  From there I found territorial videos to very helpful.  What I liked about these videos is you can see the syntax in real time.  Something I continue to have to work on is the knowing what syntax goes with what.  Seeing it being manipulated and trying to pay special attention to said syntax even if the video producer is not highlighting it specifically, taking notes along the way.  After multiple videos I realized I should seek out some cheat sheets to help with both the possibilities that jQuery gives us and for a better understanding of syntax.  From there it took me a second to find some workable code work this type of exploration which I found in CodeAcademy, which gave me an opportunity to play around with writing and changing some code with the tools jQuery provides.
