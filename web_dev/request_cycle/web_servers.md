Linux, like all operating systems has a philosophy, give the user complete control.  Like most things in life this approach comes with pros and cons.  The major pro is that the limit of what can be created using Linux is the creativity of the programmer and to a greater extent the global community of programmers.  The major con being there are no safeguards from destroying the everything that allows the operating system to run.  Many commands can cause unrecoverable harm to both ones work and the code that allows the system to work.  Linux, unlike most operating systems, has no centralized governing body or company.  It is designed by the global community and is constantly evolving as human ingenuity continues to press against the frontier of what is possible with computers and therefore a vast amount of human activities.  Some might assume that such an unregulated community would create an unruly and ineffective product, but such is simply not the case.  The global community continues to work together to make continuous improvements in an open source environment which uses no propriety software. This constant evolution creates another con, that running a Linux system will require more personal updating of ones system than structured updates from a corporate producer of an operating system.  Fundamentally, Linux empowers the user entrusting his or her knowledge to create and destroy as they please.
