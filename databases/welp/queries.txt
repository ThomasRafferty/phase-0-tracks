2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
1|3|Where slow today|2|1|2|Jimmy Johns|1|Andrea|Hanson
2|5|Favorite place to get coffee!|4|2|4|Dunkin Donuts|2|Lizz|Rafferty
3|4|Love the number 4 sandwhich|2|2|2|Jimmy Johns|2|Lizz|Rafferty
4|5|Best place to play cards|1|6|1|The River|6|Elk|Swift
5|1|This place sucks, they threw me out for going hard|1|7|1|The River|7|Dan|Dee
6|3|Wonderful selection|3|4|3|EleMar|4|Karl|Harris
7|5|Much like my father, I thought it had a wonderful selection but I also liked the service|3|5|3|EleMar|5|Matt|Harris
8|2|It was okay|5|3|5|Diamond Joe|3|Kevin|Crooks

*** Note that there is only on FROM and the JOINs are not separated with a comma.

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name,  businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
Andrea|Hanson|Jimmy Johns|3|Where slow today
Lizz|Rafferty|Dunkin Donuts|5|Favorite place to get coffee!
Lizz|Rafferty|Jimmy Johns|4|Love the number 4 sandwhich
Elk|Swift|The River|5|Best place to play cards
Dan|Dee|The River|1|This place sucks, they threw me out for going hard
Karl|Harris|EleMar|3|Wonderful selection
Matt|Harris|EleMar|5|Much like my father, I thought it had a wonderful selection but I also liked the service
Kevin|Crooks|Diamond Joe|2|It was okay

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name,  businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.name = "Jimmy Johns";
Andrea|Hanson|Jimmy Johns|3|Where slow today
Lizz|Rafferty|Jimmy Johns|4|Love the number 4 sandwhich

OR if you wanted all the data (not a clean table)

sqlite> SELECT *  FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.name = "Jimmy Johns";
1|3|Where slow today|2|1|2|Jimmy Johns|1|Andrea|Hanson
3|4|Love the number 4 sandwhich|2|2|2|Jimmy Johns|2|Lizz|Rafferty
